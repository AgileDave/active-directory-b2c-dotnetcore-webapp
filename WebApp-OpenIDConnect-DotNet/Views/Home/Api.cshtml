    <p>This is stretch challenge! Consider this challenge only after you completed the other challenges.</p>
    <p>
        To complete this challenge you need to deploy a Web API application and configure it.
        This can be your own API that is protected by your B2C tenant. Or you can use the simple API we provided.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Once you deployed and protected Web API by the same B2C tenant, you shall see the results here.</p>
